Full Cloud Pinyin is an input method that uses [Google Input Tools](https://www.google.com/inputtools/try/) as the backend. It uses [fcitx5-bridge](https://github.com/qingxiang-jia/fcitx5-bridge) so you can type pinyin with excellent prediction on Linux with Fcitx5. Historically, a version made with IBus is available [here](https://github.com/qingxiang-jia/ibus-cloud-pinyin).
